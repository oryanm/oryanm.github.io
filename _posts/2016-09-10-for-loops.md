## the history of for loops in java 

lets take a look at the for loop. it used to loop like this:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = ...

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers.get(i));
}

for (Iterator<Integer> iterator = numbers.iterator(); iterator.hasNext(); ) {
    Integer number = iterator.next();
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

since java 5 it could loop like this:

```java
for (Integer number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

that one lasted _for_ quite a _while_.

if you used google's guava you might have seen it loop somewhat like this:

```java
numbers.forEach(new Consumer<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public void accept(Integer x) {
        System.out.println(x);
    }
});
```

in java 8, `Consumer<T>` is a `@FunctionalInterface` so we can replace it with a lambda.

```java
numbers.forEach((Integer x) -> {
    System.out.println(x);
});
```

lambdas are anonymous functions that can be passed around like objects.
a function that takes as parameters, or returns, other functions is a higher-order function.
in this case, `forEach` is a higher-order function that takes a `Consumer<T>` as an argument and applies it _for each_ number in numbers.  

when a lambda has only one statement in it's body we can lose the parenthesis.  
and we can also infer the type of `x` from the type of `numbers`:

```java
numbers.forEach(x -> System.out.println(x));
```

when the parameter list is used in the same order in the lambda 
(in this case `x` is just passed on to `println`) we can replace it with a method reference:

```java
numbers.forEach(System.out::println);
```

## wait what is that @FunctionalInterface thing you just mentioned?

an interface with only one abstract method can be marked with the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation and used as a lambda. 
but how many interfaces do you know with only one method? not many. that's why we need default methods:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Class<T> {
    T abstractMethod(T t);
    
    default T method(T t) {
        return t;
    }
}
```

a default method has a default implementation. sort of like in an abstract class.

this feature is very useful on it's own, but combined with `@FunctionalInterface` it also allows us to retrofit many of the existing interfaces and use them in lambda form. 
so for example, `Comparator<T>` turns into:

```java
Collections.sort(numbers, (o1, o2) -> o1.compareTo(o2));
```

## all of this just to get rid of some anonymous class boilerplate?

well no, lambdas open the door to functional programming (just a bit) and the new streams api takes full advantage of it. 

we can get a `Stream<T>` from any `Collection<T>`.  
here we use a `Predicate<T>` to filter odd numbers:

```java
numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0);
```

we can also map from one type to another using a `Function<T>`:

```java
numbers.stream().map(n -> n.toString());
```

and we can reduce the stream to a single value using an accumulator and a BiFunction:

```java
numbers.stream()
        .map(n -> n * 2)
        .reduce(0, (sum, n) -> sum += n);
```

or maybe just collect it to a list again:

```java
numbers.stream()
        .map(n -> n * 2)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

`Collectors` has many useful ways of collecting a stream to all kinds of data structures:

```java
Collectors.toSet()
Collectors.toMap()

numbers.stream()
        .map(n -> n * 2)
        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(n -> n % 10));
```

it's important to remember that:  

* streams are not data structures themselves. they only direct the data through a series of _pipes_ and produce a result.  
* streams are _lazy_. that means that nothing gets done until a terminal operation is called.   
    * filter and map return a stream and so they are intermediate. they are just links in the pipe.  
    * reduce and collect produce a final result and so they are terminal. they are the end of the pipeline.  

for a good explanation of the consequences this has on performance [watch this][lazy].

anyway, here are a few more examples:

```java
numbers.stream().anyMatch(n -> n % 3 == 0);
numbers.stream().allMatch(n -> n % 3 == 0);

numbers.stream()
        .filter(n -> n % 3 == 0)
        .findFirst();
        
numbers.stream()
        .filter(n -> n < 3)
        .distinct()
        .sorted()
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

// get highest grade out of all grades of all students
students.stream()
    .flatMap(s -> s.getGrades())
    .collect(Collectors.maxBy(Integer::compare))
```

primitive streams have some neat functions too:

```java
IntStream.of(1,2,3,4,5).count();
LongStream.of(1,2,3,4,5).sum();
DoubleStream.of(1,2,3,4,5).average();
LongStream.of(1,2,3,4,5).max();
IntStream.of(1,2,3,4,5).min();
```

also, infinite streams:

```java
Stream.iterate(1, e -> e + 1)
        .filter(e -> e % 13 == 0)
        .filter(e -> e % 21 == 0)
        .limit(5)
        .forEach(System.out::println); // => 273 546 819 1092 1365
```

## and what is that weird method reference syntax?

method references are nothing but a shorthand notation for lambdas that do nothing but call an existing method:

```java
numbers.stream()
        // instance method
        .peek(System.out::println) // == x -> System.out.println(x)
        // static method
        .map(String::valueOf) // == x -> String.valueOf(x);
        // instance method of parameter
        .map(String::toString) // == x -> x.toString();
        // works with multiple params as long as they are used in the same order
        .reduce(String::concat); // == (carry, s) -> carry.concat(s)
```

## back up a sec

lets compare loops again:

```java
for (Integer number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}

numbers.forEach(System.out::println);
```

a shorter syntax is nice and all but there's something else going on here. 
notice that in the first example the iteration is controlled by the for loop. it's an external iteration.
in the second example it's the collection itself that controls the iteration. it's an internal iteration.
who cares? well, when the iteration is internal we can benefit from polymorphism and do crazy things like that:

```java
numbers.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
```
warning: do not try to parallel things without profiling.

## anything else?

* you might wanna take a look at `Optional<T>` since many of the methods in the streams api use it. it's a great way to avoid null checks and `NullPointerExceptions`.
* check out the new [dates api][]. greatly influenced from JodaTime. in short, use `LocalDate`, `LocalTime` and `LocalDateTime` instead of `Date` and `Calendar`
