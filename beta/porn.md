Imagine an ocean where the siren's song can be heard from everywhere at all times.

[It’s like hunger, for a poison.](https://easypeasymethod.org/)

Like wholegrain bread after a well developed appetite, you’ll no longer want the high-fructose corn syrup of internet porn.

Cutting down doesn’t work because initially the user hopes that by getting into the habit less and less, they’ll reduce their desire to watch porn. It’s not a habit, it’s addiction. The nature of any addiction is wanting more and more, not less and less.

Remember, it’s not only orgasm the brain seeks, but the novelty of the hunt that gives the water slide its thrill.
